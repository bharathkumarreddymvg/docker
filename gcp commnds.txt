Here's a step-by-step explanation of the commands you’ve listed — they describe how to build a Docker image, push it to Google Container Registry (GCR), and deploy it on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE):

---

### 1) `ls`

* **Description:** Lists the files and directories in your current folder. Helps to confirm you have the necessary files (like Dockerfile, source code) before building the image.

---

### 2) `git clone <url>`

* **Description:** Clones a remote Git repository to your local machine. This is usually your project source code.

---

### 3) `cd <dir>`

* **Description:** Changes the current directory to the cloned project directory so you can work inside it.

---

### 4) `export PROJECT_ID=projectunique no`

*(e.g., `kuberntes-46512`)*

* **Description:** Sets an environment variable for your Google Cloud project ID. This makes the commands reusable and easier to manage.

---

### 5) `docker build -t gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/hiring_analytics:v1 .`

* **Description:** Builds a Docker image from your current directory and tags it to match the format required by GCR (`gcr.io/<project-id>/<image-name>:<version>`).

---

### 6) `docker images`

* **Description:** Lists all Docker images on your local machine, including the one you just built.

---

### 7) `gcloud auth configure-docker gcr.io`

* **Description:** Configures Docker to authenticate with Google Container Registry using your Google Cloud credentials.

---

### 8) `docker push gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/hiring_analytics:v1`

* **Description:** Pushes the Docker image to Google Container Registry under your project.

---

### 9) `gcloud container clusters create hiring-cluster --num-nodes=2`

* **Description:** Creates a Kubernetes cluster named `hiring-cluster` with 2 nodes on Google Kubernetes Engine.

---

### 10) `kubectl create deployment hiring_analytics --image=gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/hiring_analytics:v1`

* **Description:** Creates a Kubernetes deployment using the image from GCR. (Note: this has an underscore `_`, which is not standard and might cause issues. The next command corrects that.)

---

### 11) `kubectl create deployment hiring-analytics --image=gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/hiring_analytics:v1`

* **Description:** Correctly creates a deployment with a hyphen `-` in the name (which is valid). This will manage your pods running the container.

---

### 12) `kubectl expose deployment hiring-analytics --type=LoadBalancer --port 80 --target-port 5000`

* **Description:** Exposes the deployment to the internet by creating a LoadBalancer service. Port 80 (external) maps to port 5000 inside the container.

---

### 13) `kubectl get service`

* **Description:** Shows the services running in your Kubernetes cluster, including their external IPs (once assigned).

---

### 14) `curl <external-ip>`

* **Description:**Sends an HTTP request to the external IP of your service to test if it's working and accessible.
